# lines of code -> block of code
re-usability is the key 
print(), type()

def - keyword used to define a function.
how many types of function are there:
a. Built-in functions, like print(), type()
b. user-defined functions or programmer funcitons - we will make 
c. Lambda functions -> m imp for int.
d. Magic methods or even called Dundle methods or super methods - oops.  In oops methods are called as funcitons.
eg __somename__
CPython
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass

Functions are also called as "First class Objects"  - oops concept.
a=5
type(a) -> class int 

1 how you define a function
a=5  -> define the variable 'a'
listx = [1,2,3,4] -> define a list that it contains integers 

def <functionname>(param1, param2, param3 ......paramn): Params are optional
    # lines of code for our function
    # return <someobject> - this is optional 

2. Call the function 
<functionname>(param1, param2, param3 ......paramn)



Max Lines of code inside a function 30 lines per best coding practice. there is no restriction as such
