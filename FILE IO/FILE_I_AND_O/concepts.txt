files are used for storing data
eg 20mb, 100mg, 1 gb - file handling
for larger data like 1tb etc what do we use - Databases.
DB -
    RDBMS(huge data) - oracle, postegresql
    NoSQL(unstructured data) MongoDB, apache cassandra
    combination of both.

types of files
video, image, text etc
binary - image etc
non-binary - text files.

open() - used to create a file, write to a file, read a file, and append to a file, how?
so in order to accomplish all those - there are modes.

14 modes in py 
- mode is nothing but a permission given to a file

r - read a file
w - create and write a file. 
a - append to a file
r+ - read and write 
w+ - write and read 
a+ - append and read
X - exclusive file system 

rb 
wb
ab
rb+
wb+
ab+
xb

b - is the mode for binary images.

r - is the deault mode.


1. r- mode 
open existing file for read operations 
f=open('abc.txt','r')
FileNotFoundError

2. w - mode 
open existing file for write operations
     if file is already available - overwrite (v imp)
     if file is not available then it will create a new file.

3. a-mode 
open existing file for append or write operation 
    if file is already available - add content to EOF 
    if file is not available - it will create a new file. 

f.seek() 

4. read and wrtite r+
read - if its avaialble then read it
read/write

5. w+ 
write/read

diff between r+ and w+ 
in r+ mode it will throw an error if the file doesnt exist as it creates it.
but in w+ it will not throw an error.

6. a+
read and write - but at the end of file. 
7. x - almost like write only  basically open in exclusive mode for write.

if the file is already available - will throw and error and NOT override( v imp diff)
if file not available then it will just create  a new file.

properties of a file
name 
mode
closed or not 
readble or not
writable or not
